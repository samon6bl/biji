*上午主观题* 中比较容易拿分的科目
* Overview of Asset Allocations
** Investment Governance(投资规划)
achieve the asset owner's =investment objectives= within the asset owner's =tisk tolerance and constraints=.
1. Articulating investment objectives
   * Defined benefit pension fund
   * Endowment fund
   * individual investor
2. Allocation of rights and responsibilities
3. investment policy statement
4. Asset allocation and rebalancing policy
5. Reporting framework
6. The governance audit
** A Quick Glance of Asset Allocation
*** *Stratefic asset allocation(SAA)* =长期=
SAA is an asset allocation that arises in =long-term= investment planning
+ 9 steps of SAA
  * return objectives
  * risk tolerance
  * investment horizon
  * constraints
  * approach to asset allocation
  * [[id:75caf407-369f-41bb-b2ab-e98b58015bbd][Capital Market Expectations]]
  * asset allocation choices for consideration
  * Test the robustness of the potential choices
  * back to step
*** Tactical Asset Allocation(TAA)(战术) =短期=
- *short-term deviations* from strategic asset allocation
- TAA is *active management* at the asset class level
*** Economic Balance Sheet
accounting balance sheet + *extended protfolio assets and liabilities*
** [#B] Asset Allocation Approaches
*** Three Categories
~investment problem~
**** Asset-only approach
maximize =Sharpe raitio=
eg. _mean-variance optimiztion(MVO)_
+ Risk measures
  * Volatiliity(standard deviation)
  * Tracking risk(tracking error, risk relative to benchmark)
  * Downside risk(semi-variance, maximum drawdown, VaR)
**** Liability-relative approach
objective of =funding liabilities=
eg. *surplus(A-L) optimization*
+ risk measures:
  * Volatility of surplus(A-L)
  * Volatility of fund(A/L)
**** Goals-based approach
=sub-portfolios= for each specified goals
risk limits can be quatified as the =maximum acceptable probability= of not achieving a goal
*** Two Categories
    =exposures= 具体、抽象
    *** Asset class-based approach
    each asset class has its own =systematic risk exposure=.
    + Five criteria to effectively specify asset class for the purpose of asset allocation:
    * Assets within an asset class should be relatively =homogeneous=
    * Asset classes should be =diversifying=.
    * Asset classes should be =mutually exclusive=.
    * The asset classes as a group should make up a preponderance of =world investable wealth=.
    * Asset classes selected for investment should have the capacity to absorb a meaningful prportion of =an investor's portfolio=.
*** Factor-based approach
desired exposures to =specified risk factors=.
_Multifactor risk models_
+ Steps
  * Specify risk factors and the desired exposure to each risk factor
  * Construct =factor portfolios= that isolate exposure to each risk factor.
  * Map the exposure in *factor space* back to *asset class space*.
=zero dollar investment=
** [#C] Implementation of Asset Allocation
_passive/active choice_
 - passive : follow benchmark(Index, liability)
 - active : beat benchmark

 - Factors on Passive/Active Choices
   + Available investments
   + Scalability of active strategies
   + Trade-off benefits and risks
   + Feasibility of investing passively while incorporating client-specific constraints
   + Beliefs concerning market informational efficiency
   + Tax status
** [#B] Reblancing Asset Allocation
*Rebalancing* is the discipline of adjusting portfolio weights to mre closely align with =SAA=.
*** Approaches to Rebalancing
**** Calendar rebalancing
=on a periodic basis=
eg. monthly, quarterly, semiannually
**** Percent-range rebalancing
* [#A] Principles of Asset Allocation
** [#A] Asset-Only Allocation
*** [#A] Mean-Variance Optimiztion
**** [#B] Introduction of MVO
=efficient portfolio= use MVO to determine
inputs:returns,risks(Std.Dev.),and pair-wise correlations
***** Utility Function
$U_{m}=E(R_{m})-0.005\lambda \sigma^{2}_{m}$
$\lambda=1\dots10$
***** Safety-first ratio
$SFR=\frac{r_{p}-MAR}{\sigma^{2}}$
#+begin_quote
Typically, this single set weights is =relatively extreme= with very large long and short positions in each asset class
#+end_quote
***** Two constraints
1. *Budget constraint*: weights must sum to 1.
2. *Non-negativity constraint*: allow only positive weights.
**** [#A] Criticisms of MVO
1. The asset allocations are highly sensitive to the inputs, especial the expected return(garbage in,garbage out)
**** Other Issues of MVO
*** [#B] Other Models
** [#B] Liability-Relative Allocation
*** Introduction of Liability-Relative Allocation
*** Approaches of liability-Relative Allocation
** Goals-Based Allocation
** Other Allocation Approaches
