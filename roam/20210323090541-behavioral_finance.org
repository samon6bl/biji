* Reading 7:The Behavioral Finance Perspective
** Introduction of Behavioral Finance and Decision Making Process
*** Traditional finance(Rational)
risk-averse,self-interested utility maximizers
*** Behavioral Finance(Normal)
**** Behavioral Finance Micro(BFMI)
Questions =the perfect rationality and decision-making process of individual investors=
**** Behavioral Finance Macro(BFMA)
BFMA questions the =efficiency of markets=
*** Decision Making Process
- Traditional finance :: normative: *rational solution* to the provlem at hand
- Behavior finance :: desriptive: *the manner in which real people actually make decisions*
- Efforts to use behavioral finance :: prescriptive: *practical advice and tools that might help people achieve results more closely approximating those of normative analysis*
*** Rational Investors
- utility theory
- Bayes' formula
- self-interested, risk-averse, perfect information, unbiased way
*** Utility function of wealth
utility functions are concave and show diminishing marginal utility of wealth
- risk-neutral
- risk seeking
- risk-averse
*** Rational Economic Man(REM)
** Behavioral versus Traditional Perspectives

| Utility maximiztion            | Satisfice                                                                           |
| Fully rational decision making | Cognitive limits on decision making(Bounded Rationality)                            |
| Risk aversion                  | Reference dependence to determine gain or loss leading to possible cognitive errors |
*** Attitudes Toward Risk
*** [#A] Prospect Theory
gain and loss

| Weak-Form EMH        | Market info. | Technical Analysis       |
| Semi Strong-Form EMH | Public info. | Fundamental Analysis     |
| Strong-Form EMH      | All info.    | Nobody can win the market |
*** Studies Challenging the EMH
**** Fundamental Anomalies
- Size effect
- Value effect
  *value stocks* outperfoemed *growth stocks* in a long time period
**** Technical Anomalies
- Moving Averages
  eg. MACD
- Trading Range Break(Support and Resistance)
**** Calendar Anomalies(January Effect)
*** The Behavioral Finance Perspective
**** Consumption and savings
- *Framing*
- *Self-control bias*
- *Mental acoounting*
**** Behavioral asset pricing
add a =sentiment premium= to the discount rate
**** Behavioral portfolio theory
construct a portfolio by layers.
- =The importance of each goal to the investor=.
- =Asset selection= will be done by layer and based on the goal for that layer.If high return is the goal, then higher-risk, more-speculative assets will be selected.Found 1 items, similar to Framing.
- =The number of assets in a layer= will reflect the investor's risk aversion.
- =information advantage= more concentrated
- =loss-averse= hold larger cash positions
**** Adaptive markets hypothesis
* [#A] Reading 8:The Behavioral Biases Of Individuals
** [#A] Cognitive Errors
*** Belief perseverance biases(心理学解释)
=RICCH= =案例=
**** Representativeness bias
based on past experiences and classifications
- too much or too little importance to new pieces of information and have *excessive turnover*
- *rules of thumb*
**** illusion of control bias
believe that they can control or influence outcomes
*fail to adequately diversify*
*keeping good records* to document the thinking behind ideas
**** Conservatism bias
**** Confirmation bias
**** Hindsight bias
overestimate the rate at which they *correctly predicted* events which could reinforce an emotional overconfidence
"Do I really remember what I predicted and recommended?"
*maintain and review complete records* to determime past errors as well as successes
*** Information processing biases
=FAAM=
**** Framing bias
differently based on the way(framed)
- fail to properly asses risk
- choose suboptimal risk for their portfolio
- trade too often
"Is my decision based on realizing a gain or a loss?"
**** Anchoring and adjustment
**** Availability bias
easily the outcome comes to mind
choose a manager based on advertisement
**** Mental accounting bias
*ignores correlation between layers of the portfolio*
** [#A] Emotional Biases
not deliberate; more of a spontaneous reaction
*harder to correct* *adapt to it rather than correct for it*
*** Loss aversion bias
- hold on to losers too long but may sell winners too quickly
- Trade too much
maintain a discipline
*** Overconfidence bias
**** Prediction overconfidence
Overcome: *Investment Policy Statement* and *Strategic Asset Allocation*
**** Self-attribution bias
the combination of *self-enhancing bias* and *self-protecting bias*
**** Self-control bias
**** Status quo bias
lazy
**** Endowment bias
hold right to it
**** Regret-aversion bias
