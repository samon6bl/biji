+ Tips:
  + *性价比很高*
  + 主观题的高频考点
  + =计算题是拿分点，定性分析题是成败关键=
  + *以理解为主*
*  Reading 1: Framework and Macro Considerations
** Framework and Challenges for Developing CME :TO-DO:
+ Capital market expectations:
  - =long-term expectations= IPS
  - =short-term expectations= make active investment decisions
+ Good forecast:
  - Unbiased, objective, and well researched
  - Efficient
  - *cross-sectional consistent* and *intertemporal consistent*
+ Steps
  1.
+ Challenges in Forecasting
  1. Limitations to using economic data
  2. Data measurement errors and biases
     - *Transcription errors*
     - *Survivorship bias*
     - *Appraisal data* *downward the standard deviation*
  3. Limitations of historical estimates
  4. Ex-post risk as a biased risk measure of ex-ante risk
     =underestimate ex-ante risk= =overestimate ex-ante anticipated returns=
  5. Biases in analysts' methods
     - Data-minning bias
     - Time-period bias
  6. Failure to account for conditioning information
  7. Misinterpretation of correlations
  8. Psychological biases
  9. Model uncertainty
** [#B] Macroeconomic Analysis
*** [#A] Analysis of Economic Growth
$Growth = trends +cycles$
+ *Exogenous shocks*
  - Changes in government policies
  - New products and technologies
  - Geopolitics
  - Natural disasters
  - Natural resources inputs
  - Financial crises
+ Decomposition of GDP
  - Growth from labor inputs
    + Growth in potential labor force size
    + Growth in actual labor force participation
  - Growth from labor productivity
    + Growth from increasing capital inputs("capital deepening")
    + Growth in total factor productivity(TFP)
+ Anchoring Bond Returns to Trend Growth
  - Bond yields will be pulled toward this level over time
  - $V_{t}^{e}=GDP \times S_{t}^{k}\times PE_{t}$
